//! mean_field — Crowd-scale order-parameter aggregator + Hopf boundary detector
//! + four-way regime classifier.
//!
//! Distilled from Zheng, Miller, Fiete, *Mean-field theory of rich oscillatory
//! dynamics in low-rank recurrent networks with activity-dependent adaptation*
//! ([arXiv:2606.30366](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.30366), MIT, Jun 2026). See
//! `katgpt-rs/.research/371_*.md` for the open research note and
//! `katgpt-rs/.plans/371_*.md` for the execution plan.
//!
//! The paper proves that combining **low-rank recurrent connectivity** with
//! **firing-rate-driven adaptation** (`τ_a · ȧ = −a + β · tanh(x)`) produces a
//! four-regime phase diagram organized by a single parameter β (adaptation
//! strength) and the chaos intensity g. The mean-field order parameters
//! `(κ, κ_a, Q)` — coherent overlap, adaptation overlap, incoherent variance —
//! close the dynamics, and the planar `(κ, κ_a)` subsystem admits a
//! **closed-form Hopf boundary** check.
//!
//! # Three composable parts (the novel 20% — the rest of the paper ships)
//!
//! 1. **[`MeanFieldOverlap`]** — one-pass aggregation of K per-NPC HLA states
//!    into the paper's `(κ, κ_a, Q)` order parameters via dot-product projection
//!    onto a frozen direction vector `n`. Population analog of
//!    `ict::BranchingDetector::last_population_mean`, but over **NPCs** (not
//!    trajectories) and onto a **learned direction** (not action probabilities).
//! 2. **`HopfBoundary`** (free function [`hopf_boundary`] + companion
//!    [`static_boundary`]) — closed-form 2×2 Jacobian eigenvalue check on
//!    `(κ, κ_a)` for oscillatory instability. **Extends** Plan 301's
//!    [`crate::subspace_phase_gate`] from *real-eigenvalue* phase transitions
//!    (`N ≥ d` input sufficiency) to *complex-eigenvalue* (Hopf) phase
//!    transitions. The discriminant
//!    `τ_a·τ_m·β·G_eff > (τ_a + τ_m − λ_eff·τ_a·G_eff)²/4` (paper Eq. 56
//!    simplified) is a one-line sigmoid-compatible gate.
//! 3. **[`RegimeClassifier`]** — combine [`MeanFieldOverlap`] + [`hopf_boundary`]
//!    + chaos intensity `g` (heuristic estimate from `Q`, or caller-injected)
//!      into a [`Regime`] enum: the paper's four-way taxonomy, distilled.
//!
//! # Latent vs raw boundary (per global AGENTS.md)
//!
//! - **Latent (local, BLAKE3-committed, never synced):** direction vector `n`,
//!   per-NPC HLA state `h_i`, adaptation overlap `κ_a`, incoherent variance `Q`.
//!   Semantic-domain quantities (mood, curiosity, style).
//! - **Raw (synced, deterministic, anti-cheat):** the [`Regime`] enum (synced
//!   as `u8` via [`Regime::as_u8`]), the scalar `κ` (crowd belief summary —
//!   needed for quorum agreement on "the crowd is in a panic wave"), the β
//!   parameter (committed via an archetype shard).
//! - **Bridge:** `κ → sigmoid(κ)` clamped to `[0,1]` for the synced "crowd
//!   coherence" scalar; `regime → u8` for the synced regime tag. Never sync
//!   the full HLA vector.
//!
//! # Performance contract
//!
//! - [`MeanFieldOverlap::aggregate_into`] is `O(K·D)` time, **zero-allocation**
//!   in the hot path (writes into pre-allocated scratch), chunk-4 inner loop
//!   for SIMD auto-vectorisation.
//! - [`hopf_boundary`] and [`RegimeClassifier::classify`] are pure f32
//!   arithmetic — no allocation, no I/O.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! All operations are deterministic and platform-independent: no SIMD dispatch
//! inside the math, no floating-point reordering. This is required for
//! anti-cheat: the [`Regime`] enum crosses the sync boundary.
//!
//! [`crate::subspace_phase_gate`]: crate::subspace_phase_gate
//!
//! Mean-Field Crowd Oscillation Regime Classifier — crowd-level (κ, κ_a, Q)
//! order-parameter aggregator + closed-form 2×2 Jacobian Hopf boundary check +
//! four-way regime taxonomy (Static / NoiseSustainedOscillation /
//! IrregularSwitching / GlobalLimitCycle). Distilled from Zheng, Miller, Fiete
//! (arXiv:2606.30366, MIT, Jun 2026). The paper's algorithmic content is ~80%
//! covered by shipped primitives (LinOSS, `subspace_phase_gate`, `temporal_deriv`,
//! `MicroRecurrentBeliefState`, `ict::BranchingDetector`); this ships the
//! missing 20% — the crowd-scale mean-field view + oscillatory-instability
//! detector + regime taxonomy. Extends Plan 301's `subspace_phase_gate` from
//! real-eigenvalue phase transitions (`N ≥ d` input sufficiency) to complex-
//! eigenvalue (Hopf) phase transitions. DEFAULT-ON (Plan 371 Phase 6, 2026-07-03): G1+G2+G3+G4+G5 PASS +
//! mandatory defend-wrong PoC (Plan 371 Phase 5 T5.1) pass.
